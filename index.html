    I'm Carlos! Nice to meet you! I have varying interests, I love to learn new things. Currently, I am learning to code, but I am also learning french and game theory in classes much like this one. Granted, not as hard. I love to laugh, enjoy cinema, and adore spending time outdoors.

    I was born in Ecuador, so my native language is Spanish. My favorite beer is called Ghost in the Machine, it's drafted in Louisiana. I have played soccer all my life, but also enjoy tennis and baseball. I love videogames, sometimes I give them too much of my free time.
